## CAD
Onshape files are [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/938009ca848e8f70363ec877/w/f0bb0f5f0f71f81ef3c97b4d/e/251c57603ced91541ac1788a). This project is fairly messy with lots of different iterations and bad naming conventions. Not fit for human consumption, but it's there.

## Dampers
We use 2 kinds of dampers. 
1. "Goo ball" dampers from the [DJI Matrice/Inspire series](https://www.terrestrialimaging.com/products/dji-matrice-200-300-series-rubber-damper?srsltid=AfmBOopQN6PGU1pUkCl2peEYZ-s4ZuK-9KpNYBQmUYXlq-m3I-rZX4Zd). Note that these take a bit of force for installation, and they can be easily torn during installation or disassebly. Use caution. 
2. Camera gimbal dampers from the DJI Mini Pro 4. Note that we only use the side with 3 "posts." Purchased [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZJTMX98?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1&th=1). The #2 thread forming screws are used as the bosses to connect the damper to the camera holder. For these to work, leave about a 0.5mm gap (don't screw them all the way down). After installing, cut excess pull tab. 

## Printing
Prints were made on a Bambu H2D out of both PLA and PETG. Both seemed to work fine, so the majority of parts were made from faster/cheaper PLA. Orientation was the Bambu Studio default for each part. Supports are necessary for all parts. Printing all the parts requires at least 2 plates on the H2D. 

Bambu Studio file is in the repo.

## Fasteners
The top "spider" damper requires [heat set inserts](https://www.amazon.com/ruthex-M3-Threaded-Inserts-RX-M3x5-7/dp/B08BCRZZS3/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.CYXB_0oopeIbtnzM2jaWJOhp5CdSJT4SrxoRYNbWBGoz2BCay_MDXh4nX70ZgaBIDdVodtFxVVowoT_KhBIy4wQeFE5IE9mUfYH0m4mKqX2vG0iHHmSGIKdzsXj92ehltR5wSSOtZ7xIB9UUP7ZU__k5VXXv0UWUoDS2Rq5ES-pIgGob0wZzE3PrtbQTAjnfmdfqT1ne7lT6iKSrc7jFOFcIASh5mShtVlbXu1bD0iw.VmIUA6fNe0WOZTDa9YbKId9nPjEPwrSBlhP9Y2QhM-M&dib_tag=se&keywords=m3+inserts&qid=1756918881&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1).

#2x3/16" trilobe [threadforming screws](https://www.mcmaster.com/99461A710/) were used to attach the Raspberry Pis and the camera modules to their prints

#2x3/8" trilobe [threadforming screws](https://www.mcmaster.com/99461A725/) were used to attach the camera holder cantilevers to the bottom damper spider. 

[M3x8 cap screws](https://www.mcmaster.com/92095A181/) were used to attach the top spider damper to the drone. 

The same Holybro-supplied M2.5 screws that held the aesthetic "caps" onto the rotors are reused to attach the new landing gear.
